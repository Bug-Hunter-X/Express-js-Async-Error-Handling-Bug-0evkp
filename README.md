This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications involving asynchronous operations and error handling.  The `bug.js` file contains code that throws an error within a `setTimeout` callback.  Because the error isn't properly caught, it can lead to unexpected behavior.  The solution, found in `bugSolution.js`, illustrates how to effectively use async/await or middleware to handle such errors gracefully. This is important for building robust and reliable Express applications.
